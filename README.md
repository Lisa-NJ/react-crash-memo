**# Use of Hooks** 

**useState**ï¼š

Define a state for every <input> element in the component Edit, and data in the component Home.

In Edit, each state variable is bound with one input element in such a way called two way binding.

```react
const [note, setNote] = useState("");  //1. Define the state variable

//4. reset the state variable - note, then trigger another render.
function noteChange(e) {
        setNote(e.target.value);
    }

//2. Show the state as value when rendered
<input type="text" value={note} onChange={noteChange} /> 
//3. noteChange is called when a user changes the value
```

In Home, how it works is shown in the above diagram.

**useEffect**ï¼š

This hook is used in these situations:

- When the app is run, it is used to fetch data from back-end by calling API;
- When the state variables the hook depends are changed, it is called to put changed information to the backend by calling API;
- Before next render happens, do some cleaning operations by calling the function put in "return".

**useRef**ï¼š

useRef is used to determine if some operations are to be done or not. It does not trigger another render, unlike useState.

**# Use of UUID** 
uuid is used to generate unique Id for an item.
